### General info
This project is simple rock, paper, scissors game created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is hand game played between you (player) and your oponent (computer).

> It is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors)

### Inspiration
This project is inspired by japanese version of rock, paper, scissors - Janken (じゃんけん).

> By the early 20th century, rock paper scissors had spread beyond Asia, especially through increased Japanese contact with the west. Its English-language name is therefore taken from a translation of the names of the three Japanese hand-gestures for rock, paper and scissors: elsewhere in Asia the open-palm gesture represents "cloth" rather than "paper". The shape of the scissors is also adopted from the Japanese style. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors)
